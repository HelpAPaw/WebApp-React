        <p>It’s a debate that’s been going on for more than a decade, with many swearing by either side. But, there is a right answer, and it’s not quite as clear cut as many would hope.</p>
        <p>In this blog post, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about plain text and HTML emails, and help you choose the right format for your email.</p>
        <p>HTML vs Plain Text: What’s the Difference?</p>
        <p>Let’s start by taking a quick look at the differences between plain text emails and HTML emails.The simplest explanation is that an HTML will contain images and colors while a plain text email contains no images, no graphics, and no formatting.</p>

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
